Here are my Project Ideas:
1. Predict the proportion of Harris County population that would be diagnosed with Diabetes over the next 5 years.
Diabetes is one of the chronic diseases that affects Americans. It is estimated that 70% of all healthcare costs is used in the care of patients with the top five chronic diseases. Diabetes to a large extent is preventable and also can be well managed to increase quality of life and cost of care. Having the capability to predict the proportion of the population that could be diagnosed in the near future could help in the allocation of resources to manage the condition and also the target the "at risk" population to provide intervention care that could reduce the occurrence of the condition. 
2. Locate the top  locations in Houston where a fatal road traffic accident is likely to occur
700 people are killed yearly in the Houston area in motor accidents. Identify the area that these accidents are most likely to occur.
3. What factors makes a patient most likely to use telemedicine
Advances in EMR records and social media has created a climate where patients are open to telemedicine. In addition, billing for tele vists are cheaper. What factors influence patient's decision to use telemedicine and how can this information be used to target the patients who would be most receptive to these visits.
